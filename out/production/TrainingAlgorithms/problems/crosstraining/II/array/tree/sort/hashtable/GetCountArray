Given an array A of length N containing all positive integers from [1...N]. How to get an array B such that B[i] represents how many elements A[j] (j > i) in array A that are smaller than A[i].

Assumptions:

The given array A is not null.
Examples:

A = { 4, 1, 3, 2 }, we should get B = { 3, 0, 1, 0 }.
Requirement:

time complexity = O(nlogn).
