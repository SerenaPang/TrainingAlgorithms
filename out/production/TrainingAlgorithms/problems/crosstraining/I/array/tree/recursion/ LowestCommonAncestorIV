Given K nodes in a binary tree, find their lowest common ancestor.

Assumptions

K >= 2
There is no parent pointer for the nodes in the binary tree
The given K nodes are guaranteed to be in the binary tree
Examples

        5

      /   \

     9     12

   /  \      \

  2    3      14

The lowest common ancestor of 2, 3, 14 is 5

The lowest common ancestor of 2, 3, 9 is 9
