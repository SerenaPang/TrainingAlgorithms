Given the postorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree, reconstruct the original tree.

Assumptions

The given sequence is not null
There are no duplicate keys in the binary search tree
Examples

postorder traversal = {1, 4, 3, 11, 8, 5}

the corresponding binary search tree is

        5

      /    \

    3        8

  /   \        \

1      4        11

How is the binary tree represented?

We use the pre order traversal sequence with a special symbol "#" denoting the null node.

For Example:

The sequence [1, 2, #, #, 3, 4, #, #, #] represents the following binary tree:

    1

  /   \

 2     3

      /

    4
