Given a set of n integers, divide the set in two subsets of n/2 sizes each such that the difference of the sum of two subsets is as minimum as possible.
Return the minimum difference(absolute value).
Assumptions:
The given integer array is not null and it has length of >= 2.
Examples:
{1, 3, 2} can be divided into {1, 2} and {3}, the minimum difference is 0
