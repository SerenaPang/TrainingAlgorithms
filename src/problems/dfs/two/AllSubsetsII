All Subsequences of Sorted String


Given a set of characters represented by a String, return a list containing all subsets of the characters. Notice that each subset returned will be sorted to remove the sequence.

Assumptions

There could be duplicate characters in the original set. subsets with repeated characters
Examples

Set = "abc", all the subsets are ["", "a", "ab", "abc", "ac", "b", "bc", "c"]
Set = "abb", all the subsets are ["", "a", "ab", "abb", "b", "bb"]
Set = "abab", all the subsets are ["", "a", "aa","aab", "aabb", "ab","abb","b", "bb"]
Set = "", all the subsets are [""]
Set = null, all the subsets are []
