Given an array of 2D coordinates of points (all the coordinates are integers),
find the largest number of points that can be crossed by a single line in 2D space.

Assumptions

The given array is not null and it has at least 2 points
Examples

<0, 0>, <1, 1>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, the maximum number of points on a line is 3(<0, 0>, <1, 1>, <3, 3> are on the same line)
