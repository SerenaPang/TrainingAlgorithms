Given M nodes in a K-nary tree, find their lowest common ancestor.

Assumptions

- M >= 2.

- There is no parent pointer for the nodes in the K-nary tree.

- The given M nodes are guaranteed to be in the K-nary tree.

Examples

        5

      /   \

     9   12

   / | \      \

  1 2 3     14



The lowest common ancestor of 2, 3, 14 is 5.

The lowest common ancestor of 2, 3, 9 is 9.
