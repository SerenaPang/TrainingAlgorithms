Get the list of keys in a given binary tree layer by layer in zig-zag order.

Examples

        5

      /    \

    3        8

  /   \        \

 1     4        11

the result is [5, 3, 8, 11, 4, 1]

Corner Cases

What if the binary tree is null? Return an empty list in this case.
How is the binary tree represented?

We use the level order traversal sequence with a special symbol "#" denoting the null node.

For Example:

The sequence [1, 2, 3, #, #, 4] represents the following binary tree:

    1

  /   \

 2     3

      /

    4
