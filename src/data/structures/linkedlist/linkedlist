Memory Layout: Non consecutive; overhead of multiple object with the "next" reference
Random access time: O(n) -> we can only traverse from the head of the linked list
Search time(unsorted): O(n)
Search time(sorted): O(n)


For list, we need to always know where the "HEAD" is, so that we can traverse/find any elements
in the list by iterating the "next" reference
