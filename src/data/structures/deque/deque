Operations:
All operations' cost is O(1)
- insert: offerFirst(e), offerLast(e)
- remove: pollFirst(), pollLast();
- examine: peekFirst(), peekLast()
- isEmpty()
- size()

queue and stack and deque are implemented by: LinkedList, ArrayDeque

use ArrayDeque is better than Linked List:
Linked structures are possibly the worst structure to iterate with a cache miss on each element. On top of it they consume way more memory.
If you need add/remove of the both ends, ArrayDeque is significantly better than a linked list. Random access each element is also O(1) for a cyclic queue.
The only better operation of a linked list is removing the current element during iteration.
